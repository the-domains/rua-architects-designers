  We are working on a new house extension in Cork. We are using a brick facade
  with internal parquet floors and glue lam beams. At this early stage we have
  not yet developed the expression of the brick texture. We are hoping to use a
  flemish bond on the recessed element and a stacked bond on the expressed west
  face. The internal space uses an eclectic interior and the new kitchen is
  retrofitted back into the existing house. This will move quickly to detail
  design and tender.
