  for 20 years. Their work is innovative, sustainable, award winning and
  entirely different to other practices. They seek to push the boundaries of the
  mundane to excite, enthuse and elate. Their interiors and architecture have
  been celebrated worldwide at awards and exhibitions from here in Ireland to
  Italy, Singapore, China and the US.
