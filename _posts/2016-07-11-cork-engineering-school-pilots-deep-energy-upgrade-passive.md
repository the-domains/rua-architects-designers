  When the Regional Technical College network sprang up around Ireland in the
  late sixties and early seventies, energy was cheap. Ensuring that the building
  envelope delivered a high thermal performance was not a priority. As a result,
  the school of mechanical and process engineering at Cork Institute of
  Technology has not been a particularly comfortable place in which to work or
  study.
