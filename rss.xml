            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cork engineering school pilots deep energy upgrade - passivehouseplus.ie</h1><p>When the Regional Technical College network sprang up around Ireland in the late sixties and early seventies, energy was cheap. Ensuring that the building envelope delivered a high thermal performance was not a priority. As a result, the school of mechanical and process engineering at Cork Institute of Technology has not been a particularly comfortable place in which to work or study.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/6d0c2bddb762a3ca03d2f2703341bdb6/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fpassivehouseplus.ie%2Fimages%2Fmagazine_images%2FVol_1_-_Iss_03%2FCork-engineering-school-01.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A new vision for Ireland as 'design island'</h1><p>For decades, Irish design was inextricably linked to a thriving community of craft producers, a strong Irish presence in international fashion and a successful cohort of long established indigenous companies designing and manufacturing on an industrial scale. But times have changed and so has the meaning of "designed in Ireland".</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/362d098798eeac9a5040264b450275f2/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fpolopoly_fs%2F1.2532469.1455281373!%2Fimage%2Fimage.jpg"></article>]]></description>
