            <title><![CDATA[New House Extension in Cork]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New House Extension in Cork</h1><p>We are working on a new house extension in Cork. We are using a brick facade with internal parquet floors and glue lam beams. At this early stage we have not yet developed the expression of the brick texture. We are hoping to use a flemish bond on the recessed element and a stacked bond on the expressed west face. The internal space uses an eclectic interior and the new kitchen is retrofitted back into the existing house. This will move quickly to detail design and tender.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b3424574fefe0843640705adcee75beb3635885f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
